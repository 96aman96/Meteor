# Meteor Engine

Meteor is a custom Game Engine that I am working on, Ideally it is supposed to work on both windows and Linux.
As of now there is no goal but I thought working on an engine in my free time would help me better understand game development.

## Dependencies

As of now the engine includes the following libraries.
- [entt] via single header include
- [ImGui] via source
- [Boost v1.73] via static lib
- [D3DX12] via single header include
- [DirectXMath] via NuGet	
- [fmt] via vcpkg
- [assimp] via static lib
- [DirectXTex] via static lib
